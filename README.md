## Game Jam 2021 Project
Team: Segura | Chansy | Racca | Mejia

A game based on the theme `lost and found`.

The world loves rainbows, but they don't care for the rain.
The gray clouds of the world are sad because people are
unhappy to see them since they are a sign of bad weather to come.
As the givers of rainbows, though, they also have the ability to take colors away too!
One day they decide to take all the colors away. You play as a 6 year old girl
named Azure who's mission it is to restore colors to the world.
